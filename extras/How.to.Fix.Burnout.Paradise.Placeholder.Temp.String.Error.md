1. Verify the integrity of game files. If you have the game on Steam, you can right-click on the game in your library, select Properties, go to the Local Files tab, and click on Verify Integrity of Game Files. This will check if there are any missing or corrupted files and replace them if needed.
2. Reinstall the game. If verifying the files does not work, you might need to uninstall and reinstall the game completely. This will ensure that you have a fresh copy of the game without any modifications or errors. Make sure to back up your save files before doing this.
3. Update your drivers. Sometimes, outdated or faulty drivers can cause compatibility issues with the game. To update your drivers, you can use a tool like Driver Easy or Driver Booster, or you can manually download and install the latest drivers from your device manufacturer's website.
