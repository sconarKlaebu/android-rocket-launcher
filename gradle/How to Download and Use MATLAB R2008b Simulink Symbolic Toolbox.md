# How to Download and Use MATLAB R2008b Simulink Symbolic Toolbox
 
MATLAB R2008b is a software package for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It includes a variety of toolboxes that extend its functionality for different applications. One of these toolboxes is the Simulink Symbolic Toolbox, which allows you to perform symbolic math computations in Simulink models.

The Simulink Symbolic Toolbox provides blocks and functions for solving, plotting, and manipulating symbolic math equations. You can create, run, and share symbolic math code in the MATLAB Live Editor. You can also generate MATLAB functions, Simulink function blocks, and Simscape equations directly from symbolic expressions.
 
If you want to download and use MATLAB R2008b Simulink Symbolic Toolbox, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure you have a license for MATLAB R2008b and the Simulink Symbolic Toolbox. You can purchase a license from the MathWorks website[^1^] or contact your sales representative. If you are working in an academic institution with a site-wide license, you may need to contact your IT staff to find out where the installation files are.
2. Run the MATLAB installer and select the Simulink Symbolic Toolbox from the list of available toolboxes. The installer will detect which toolboxes are on your license and will give you an option to pick which ones you want to install.
3. After the installation is complete, launch MATLAB R2008b and open Simulink. You can access the Simulink Symbolic Toolbox blocks from the Library Browser under Math Operations > Symbolic Math Toolbox.
4. To use the Simulink Symbolic Toolbox functions, you need to load the toolbox in MATLAB using the command `syms`. You can then use the toolbox functions in the MATLAB Command Window or in the MATLAB Live Editor.

For more information on how to use the Simulink Symbolic Toolbox, you can refer to the documentation[^1^] or check out some examples[^1^]. You can also find answers to common questions on the MATLAB Answers forum[^2^].
  
In this section, we will show you how to plot a symbolic expression in Simulink using the Simulink Symbolic Toolbox. We will use the example of plotting the function `f(x) = sin(x) + cos(2*x)` for `x` ranging from 0 to 10.
 
To plot a symbolic expression in Simulink, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new Simulink model and save it as `symbolic_plot.slx`.
2. Drag and drop a Symbolic Math Function block from the Library Browser under Math Operations > Symbolic Math Toolbox to the model. Double-click on the block and enter the following code in the MATLAB Function field: `function y = fcn(x)
y = sin(x) + cos(2*x);`
3. Drag and drop a Ramp block from the Library Browser under Sources to the model. Double-click on the block and set the Slope to 1 and the Start time to 0. This block will generate a ramp signal that will serve as the input `x` for the symbolic function.
4. Drag and drop a Scope block from the Library Browser under Sinks to the model. This block will display the output `y` of the symbolic function.
5. Connect the Ramp block to the input of the Symbolic Math Function block and connect the output of the Symbolic Math Function block to the input of the Scope block.
6. Click on the Simulation tab and set the Stop time to 10. This will run the simulation for 10 seconds.
7. Click on the Run button to start the simulation. You can then double-click on the Scope block to see the plot of `f(x)` versus `x`.

You should see a plot similar to this:
