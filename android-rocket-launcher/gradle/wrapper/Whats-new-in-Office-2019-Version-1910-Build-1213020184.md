Office 2019 is updated approximately once a month, usually on the second Tuesday of the month, using the Click-to-Run technology. This means that updates are downloaded and installed automatically from the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN) on the internet, without requiring separate downloads or patches. Updates are cumulative, so the latest version of Office 2019 contains all the previous updates.
 
To check your version of Office 2019, open any Office app, such as Word or Excel, and go to File > Account. Under Product Information, you can see the version number and the update channel. To manually check for updates, click Update Options > Update Now.
 
The new update for Office 2019 brings some new features and enhancements for Office apps, such as:
 
- Word: You can now use @mentions in comments to tag other people and get their attention. You can also see a summary of all the comments in a document by clicking Review > Show Comments.
- Excel: You can now use XLOOKUP function to find values in a table or a range by row. You can also use XMATCH function to return the relative position of an item in an array that matches a specified value.
- PowerPoint: You can now insert animated 3D graphics to make your presentations more engaging and dynamic. You can also use Morph transition to create fluid animations between slides.
- Outlook: You can now use Focused Inbox to prioritize your emails and separate them into two tabs: Focused and Other. You can also use @mentions in emails to tag other people and get their attention.

Office 2019 is the latest version of Microsoft's productivity suite for Windows desktops. It is designed for customers who don't want to use the cloud-based Office 365 subscription service, but still want to get the most out of Office apps. Office 2019 includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Publisher. It also includes access to Skype for Business and OneDrive for Business.
 
Office 2019 is a one-time purchase that comes with classic versions of the Office apps installed on one PC or Mac. It does not receive new features, but it does receive regular security and quality updates. Office 2019 is supported for five years under the Fixed Lifecycle Policy.
 
If you want to get new Office features on an on-going basis, you should consider moving to an Office 365 (or Microsoft 365) plan that includes Office. Office 365 is a subscription service that gives you access to the latest versions of the Office apps across multiple devices. It also includes cloud services such as online storage, email, collaboration, and more. Office 365 is updated monthly with new features and improvements.
